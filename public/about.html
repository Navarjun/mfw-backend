            <i>A Documentary Project
                <br/>Dedicated to the Organizers and Participants</i>
            <i>of the Boston Women&rsquo;s March, January 21, 2017</i>
        </p>
        <p>Art of the March is an online archive and interactive presentation of protest signs and posters collected in the
            aftermath of the historic Boston Women&rsquo;s March on January 21, 2017. </p>
        <p>This website contains digital images of over 6000 signs placed by protesters on the iron fence of the Boston Commons
            old Central Burying Grounds and along its perimeter as the march ended. A trio of college professors asked city
            parks workers, who were prepared to clean the site and trash them, for permission to collect them and volunteers
            from the public joined in gathering them from the site and loading them into a rented van.</p>
        <p>This collection provides a snapshot nearly complete sample of the signs brought to the protest in their full range
            of issues, emotions and visual expressions. The signs are handmade and unique, but at the same time connected
            through a rich web of cultural references, themes, memes, and visual styles. As the most extensive collection
            of contemporary protest signs representing a single event of this scale, it is a valuable reference resource
            for scholars, activists and people interested in social movements, civic media and vernacular design. </p>
        <h4>Why archive these signs?</h4>
        <p>Beyond the diverse political leanings of those who participated in the Boston Women&rsquo;s march, this collection
            reveals a wealth of information on contemporary civil society in an age of political polarization and where instant
            social communication is networked. The collection speaks for current political rhetoric, slogans, debates and
            concerns of civil society and splinter groups in the United States of America. It brings together an abundance
            of revelatory visual examples with which to study the voices and visions of social movements, analyze communication
            concepts, and preserve idiosyncratic expression in the era of social network media. It brings to light old and
            new aesthetics of personal, social and political strategies.</p>
        <h4>How was this accomplished?</h4>
        <p>During a period of time while the signs and posters were stored a team of Northeastern University researchers organized
            and facilitated a weekend documentation event where volunteers from the university and the Boston area photographed
            and catalogued the posters. Research grants from Northeastern University allowed further sorting, tagging, analysis
            and categorization the digitized images. Designers, software developers and archivists collaborated with the
            research team to create various digital means to examine, sort &nbsp;and annotate the documents and images, resulting
            in this first public view of the entire collection.</p>
